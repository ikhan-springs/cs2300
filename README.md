# CS 2300

This repository contains my Java programming projects for the course CS 2300: Computational Linear Algebra.

CS 2300 covers mathematical as well as computational aspects of linear algebra. The class also explores these concepts: Vectors, Matrices, 2D, 3D, and ND Transforms and Graphics, Systems of Linear Equations, Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors, Numerical Stability, and Linear Filters/Predictors.

I completed this course at UCCS in December 2021. A brief description of the outcome of each project is given below. A more detailed description can be found at the top of each program file.

Project #1: Matrix manipulation program (matrix.txt corresponds with this project)

Project #2: Implicit and parametric equations (CS2300P2Data.txt corresponds with this project)

Project #3: Forward and inverse kinematics (config.txt corresponds with this project)
